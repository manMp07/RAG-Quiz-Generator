LEC-3: Multi-Tasking vs Multi-Threading Program: A Program is an executable file which contains a certain set of instructions written to complete the specific job or operation on your computer. • It’s a compiled code. Ready to be executed. • Stored in Disk Process: Program under execution. Resides in Computer’s primary memory (RAM). Thread: • Single sequence stream within a process. • An independent path of execution in a process. • Light-weight process. • Used to achieve parallelism by dividing a process’s tasks which are independent path of execution. • E.g., Multiple tabs in a browser, text editor (When you are typing in an editor, spell- checking, formatting of text and saving the text are done concurrently by multiple threads.) Multi-Tasking Multi-Threading The execution of more than one task simultaneously is called as multitasking. A process is divided into several different sub-tasks called as threads, which has its own path of execution. This concept is called as multithreading. Concept of more than 1 processes being context switched. Concept of more than 1 thread. Threads are context switched. No. of CPU 1. No. of CPU >= 1. (Better to have more than 1) Isolation and memory protection exists. OS must allocate separate memory and resources to each program that CPU is executing. No isolation and memory protection, resources are shared among threads of that process. OS allocates memory to a process; multiple threads of that process share the same memory and resources allocated to the process. Thread Scheduling: Threads are scheduled for execution based on their priority. Even though threads are executing within the runtime, all threads are assigned processor time slices by the operating system. Difference between Thread Context Switching and Process Context Switching: Thread Context switching Process context switching OS saves current state of thread & switches to another thread of same process. OS saves current state of process & switches to another process by restoring its state. CodeHelp Doesn’t includes switching of memory address space. (But Program counter, registers & stack are included.) Includes switching of memory address space. Fast switching. Slow switching. CPU’s cache state is preserved. CPU’s cache state is flushed. CodeHelp LEC-4: Components of OS 1. Kernel: A kernel is that part of the operating system which interacts directly with the hardware and performs the most crucial tasks. a. Heart of OS/Core component b. Very first part of OS to load on start-up. 2. User space: Where application software runs, apps don’t have privileged access to the underlying hardware. It interacts with kernel. a. GUI b. CLI A shell, also known as a command interpreter, is that part of the operating system that receives commands from the users and gets them executed. Functions of Kernel: 1. Process management: a. Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs. b. Creating & deleting both user and system process. c. Suspending and resuming processes d. Providing mechanisms for process synchronization or process communication. 2. Memory management: a. Allocating and deallocating memory space as per need. b. Keeping track of which part of memory are currently being used and by which process. 3. File management: a. Creating and deleting files. b. Creating and deleting directories to organize files. c. Mapping files into secondary storage. d. Backup support onto a stable storage media. 4. I/O management: to manage and control I/O operations and I/O devices a. Buffering (data copy between two devices), caching and spooling. i. Spooling 1. Within differing speed two jobs. 2. Eg. Print spooling and mail spooling. ii. Buffering 1. Within one job. 2. Eg. Youtube video buffering iii. Caching 1. Memory caching, Web caching etc. a. All functions are in kernel itself. b. Bulky in size. c. Memory required to run is high. d. Less reliable, one module crashes -> whole kernel is down. e. High performance as communication is fast. (Less user mode, kernel mode overheads) f. Eg. Linux, Unix, MS-DOS. Types of Kernels: 1. Monolithic kernel CodeHelp 2. Micro Kernel a. Only major functions are in kernel. i. Memory mgmt. ii. Process mgmt. b. File mgmt. and IO mgmt. are in User-space. c. smaller in size. d. More Reliable e. More stable f. Performance is slow. g. Overhead switching b/w user mode and kernel mode. h. Eg. L4 Linux, Symbian OS, MINIX etc. 3. Hybrid Kernel: a. Advantages of both worlds. (File mgmt. in User space and rest in Kernel space. ) b. Combined approach. c. Speed and design of mono. d. Modularity and stability of micro. e. Eg. MacOS, Windows NT/7/10 f. IPC also happens but lesser overheads 4. Nano/Exo kernels… Q. How will communication happen between user mode and kernel mode? Ans. Inter process communication (IPC). 1. Two processes executing independently, having independent memory space (Memory protection), But some may need to communicate to work. 2. Done by shared memory and message passing. CodeHelp
